# HomeLoanPrediction
The prediction of home loan is made from different features and their importance in the assessment of the home loan. It took quite a while to write the code.
I have provided explainatory information at each and every step, make good use of it for understanding.
Home loan prediction using supervised machine learning algorithm is the correct combination.While giving out a home loan probability or prediction of repayment should be accurate to avoid problems. 
Decision Tree is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that uses a set of rules to make decisions, similarly to how humans make decisions. One way to think of a Machine Learning classification algorithm is that it is built to make decisions.
